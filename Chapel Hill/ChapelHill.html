    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>I projected a vector shape file of the countries of the world. Then, while running the indicatrix mapper plugin, I searched for different projections by using the filter word "world". I tried a bunch of different ones because some of them didn't seem to work. I finally found the ESRI 54052 and the EPSG 4087 projections which worked well.</p>
